<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 1</span> Data Analysis with R<a href="Rintro.html#Rintro" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p><span class="newthought">Data analytics is a fast developing, exciting topic of research and application that impacts many areas of our lives.</span> We are today experiencing an authentic knowledge revolution that integrates the statistical analysis of data using computers. Here you are introduced to data analytics. After you spend a few hours learning the basics of the R software system for analytics, the rest is straightforward. From a small investment in learning how the system works, you gain access to much data analytic prowess using one of the primary languages of modern data science.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Overview<a href="Rintro.html#overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><span class="newthought">We begin with some basic concepts of data analytics.</span>
All data analysis, as in 100%, is done on the computer. We use R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team 2022</a>)</span> as the app for data analytics, the same analysis system many data scientists use doing real data science throughout the world.</p>
<p>A core set of tasks form part of <em>every</em> analytics project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Rintro.html#read">Read</a> the data from a computer file into the analysis system, here R.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="Rintro.html#count">Count</a> the data values recorded for each variable with either a bar chart for a variable with few unique values or a histogram for a variable with many unique values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following content explains how to access and use R to accomplish these essential tasks. Sequentially follow the provided instructions, from downloading R to your computer or use in the cloud, reading data into R, and then analyzing that data. Besides the provided, self-sufficient written instructions, also find optional referenced videos and reading material.</p>
<p>Work through the following content step-by-step. Each step is straightforward. Skipping steps or skimming the content, however, leads to nowhere except confusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow along with your computer, actively running each step as you proceed through this material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get the basics down, and the rest readily follows.</p>
<div id="RvsExcel" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> R vs.Â Excel<a href="Rintro.html#RvsExcel" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Excel and R analyze data from function calls.</span> You already know more about using R than you thought you did. Excel implements many built-in functions, plus user-defined functions (which Excel calls macros), and so does R.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Function</em>: Performs the computations that transform data values into the results, the output of the analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The input into a data analysis function is data. The output of a function can appear in several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>text in the form of writing and tables</li>
<li>data visualizations in a graphics format such as <em>pdf</em> or <em>png</em></li>
<li>data transformed from the original input data.</li>
</ul>
<p>To run an R program is to process the code, which consists of a sequence of activating functions to accomplish a corresponding sequence of analyses.</p>
<div id="functions" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.1.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.1</span> Function Calls<a href="Rintro.html#functions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p style="float: right;">
<img width="130" style="padding-left: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right:.5em;" src="images/ExcelFunction.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="newthought">R and Excel differ on how to instruct a function to do its work.</span> To illustrate, consider the following six data values, the annual salaries of six employees at a company. Find the variable name <em>Salary</em> in the first row of the Excel worksheet that contains the data values, listed in the same column under the variable name. The standard organization of data for analysis lists the variable names in the first row. List data values for that variable in the corresponding column, beginning in the second row.</p>
<p>What is the average salary? Compute the average, more technically called the (arithmetic) mean, either with the Excel function <code>average()</code> or with the R function <code>mean()</code>. Both functions provide the same result, but the respective languages name their functions differently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Function call</em>: Process the computations of a function from within a data analysis system such as Excel or R.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Excel, enter the function call into a cell in the worksheet, sharing the same type of storage area, a worksheet cell, as the data itself.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">
In this example, enter the function call beneath the column of data into the 8th cell in Column A. Specify the data for analysis with a <em>cell range</em>, such as the relative cell range A2:A7. This cell range refers to cells in the same column relative to the cell in which to enter the function call. This cell range extends from the cell in the second row of Column A to the cell in the seventh row.
</p>
<p>R works differently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Command line</em>: R presents a prompt, <code>&gt;</code>, which indicates where to enter instructions for data analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Invoke R functions from the command line. Unlike Excel, R separates the data from the instructions to analyze that data, an advantage that contributes to the power of R for data analysis. With R, enter function calls at the command line apart from the storage area of the data.</p>
<p><img src="images/RCommandPrompt.png" width="22%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>After entering an instruction in response to the <code>&gt;</code>, press Enter/Return, which instructs R to process the instruction, and then display a new prompt on a new command line. Instructions for an R data analysis consist of at least several lines of code entered at successive command lines.</p>
<p>R can directly read data stored within an Excel worksheet. To begin this analysis, <a href="Rintro.html#read">read</a> the Excel worksheet into R from an instruction you enter at the command line. Instead of the <code>mean()</code> function, here invoke the more general <code>Histogram()</code> function, which computes the mean of <em>Salary</em>, plus many other statistics, plus the histogram.</p>
<p>To analyze the data values for a variable in R, always refer to the variableâs name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R references the data values for a variable by the variableâs name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always be aware of the exact spelling of the variable names that define the data, including capitalization.</p>
<p>In this example, specify the data to analyze with the corresponding variable name, here <em>Salary</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/R_HistogramPrompt.png" width="22%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>As with the Excel example, there is <em>no programming</em> involved in this analysis with R. The programming was done by the people who wrote the functions. Instead of programming code, to use either Excel or R in this example, enter a simple function call to analyze the data. In this example, the R function accomplished much more than the computation of a simple mean. Achieving the equivalent analysis with Excel involves much more work.</p>
<p>We have seen that both Excel and R analyze the data values for a variable organized within a column, though with different user interfaces. R, however, presents several advantages.</p>
</div>
<div id="advantages-of-r" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.1.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.2</span> Advantages of R<a href="Rintro.html#advantages-of-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><span class="newthought">Data scientists use R (or similar languages) for their analyses</span> instead of Excel. Some reasons for the preference for R and related languages follow.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
Excel is great for data entry and viewing data as a spreadsheet app, but provides only the most basic statistical computations. Excel <em>not</em> a serious app for data analysis.
</li>
<li>
Once the concept of working with an app like R is understood, less time is required to conduct an analysis, such as entering a simple <code>Histogram(Salary)</code>, obtained in Excel only with a cumbersome set of procedures.
</li>
<li>
R does Big Data, efficiently handling data sets with millions of rows of data, limited only by the computerâs available memory.
</li>
<li>
R separates the instructions for the analysis of data from the data. This separation makes debugging errors much more straightforward than complicated Excel files that can include multiple, linked worksheets that easily can contain hidden errors.
<li>
Obtain each R analysis with one or more instructions, function calls, that can be saved for future use instead of irrecoverable mouse clicks. The results of R analyses are <i>reproducible</i>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The multiple instructions to perform an R analysis document exactly how to conduct the analysis. As shown later, save these instructions in a file for later use to repeat the analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reproducibility</em>: Analyses can be re-run in the future to reproduce previously obtained results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In real world data analysis <em>no one enters code directly into R</em>. Instead the analyst writes the R instructions into a file, able to retrieve and re-run the instructions at any time. Saving the R code allows for reproducible analysis.</p>
<p>The saved R code instructs how to accomplish the analysis, a set of instructions anyone with access can repeat. The instructions for analyses done by one person become accessible to all applicable members of your organization at any subsequent point in time, including yourself. On the contrary, those Excel mouse clicks disappear into digital dust.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my 2021 publication in the <em>Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-GerbR" role="doc-biblioref">D. W. Gerbing 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âFrom the perspective of data science, Excel worksheets exhibit a fundamental flaw, the confounding of the data with the instructions to process that data. Both data and data processing instructions are entered into adjacent cells stored within the same worksheet. On the contrary, R and Python separately store data and data processing instructions into different filesâ (p.Â 251).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much better to separate your data from the code. Countless overly complex Excel worksheets for business processes are horrendous to debug and understand in their complexity. Let the (moderate size) data reside within Excel, but use Python or similar language to write your code that manipulates and analyzes your data. If needed, export the results of your specified computations back to Excel. Python writes data to Excel files as easily as it reads data from Excel worksheets.</p>
<p>Separate your data from your code to manipulate that data. Data analysis programming languages such as Python and R provide that separation. In my opinion, Excel is vastly overused and a detriment to many business operations. Welcome, instead, to the world of real data science.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> <strong>lessR</strong> Enhancements<a href="Rintro.html#lessr-enhancements" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Standard R is for geeks.</span> R analyses typically involve writing programming code well beyond just a few function calls.
I have made using R for basic data analysis much more straightforward with my 45 or so functions that complement the standard R functions, such as my <code>Histogram()</code> function. These functions, and the much more extensive and helpful error diagnostics that my functions provide, result in a more or less âun-geekedâ R. The set of these functions are included in the package called <strong>lessR</strong>, the basis for my article in the <em>Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>lessR</strong> function calls are straightforward â only function calls, no programming required to obtain comprehensive results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>lessR</strong> organizes functions into what the R ecosystem refers to as a package. The full R ecosystem, available on servers worldwide, consists of the hundreds of base (standard) R functions included with the installation of R, plus the functions found in additional packages that fulfill a strict set of requirements before published on the R servers. Downloading R installs all the base R functions. Separately download packages such as <strong>lessR</strong> to access additional functions, all accessed via the standard R environment.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Getting Started<a href="Rintro.html#start" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Download and install R on your computer, or run via a web browser in the cloud.</span> The choice is yours. R works the same regardless of the platform on which it is run. Of course, running in the cloud requires an active Internet connection. With your data and your data processing app on your own computer you maintain a level of independence and security not available with cloud processing, but you do need a computer with more than just a web browser.</p>
<div id="do-r-in-the-cloud" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Do R in the Cloud<a href="Rintro.html#do-r-in-the-cloud" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="newthought">From the cloud, access R with a web browser on any computing device</span>, such as a Chromebook or an iPad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The cloud</em>: One or more computer servers, usually in locations unknown to the users, that run applications accessed via a standard web browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important company in the R ecosystem, Posit (formerly RStudio, Inc.), provides a free cloud account for running R within the app called RStudio at <code>posit.cloud</code>. Most people run R from within RStudio. In general, running R in the cloud is the same as running R on your computer. Just from examining the RStudio window you could not tell if you were running in the cloud or on your computer except that the listed file directory under the Files tab begins with Cloud.</p>
<p>A free Posit account is limited to 25 free hours per month. This time limit is not just the time the computer requires to perform the data analysis computations, but also includes the time that a cloud project is open. Wait to log into your account until you are ready to enter the commands needed to do an analysis, and then log out of your account when an analysis is complete. Restricting the time you access your cloud account to the time entering commands and doing an analysis should typically allow data analysis assignments to be completed in a basic data analysis course within the time constraint. View the status of your account by clicking on the icon at the top-right with your initials.</p>
<p>Off-loading computer processing from your own computer to the cloud, or even doing analysis without a standard computer such as doing R analysis via a Chromebook or iPad, can save money. Typically not needed, but even if paying a small amount for monthly access to R in the cloud can be much cheaper than buying a computer or upgrading to a more powerful computer. The strategy of off-loading computer processing and storage, of course, applies to not just running R, but to many types of data processing. Many companies now maintain and access data bases in the cloud. Many people store not just data files, but photographs, videos and other types of information in the cloud.</p>
<p>If you choose the cloud for R data processing, follow these <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/R/RStudioCloud.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud directions</a>.

<p>Running R on your computer, of course, requires to first download the R app to your computer. Although optional, most people also download a second app called RStudio from which to run R.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1</span> Download and Run R<a href="Rintro.html#getR" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><span class="newthought">R is free and runs the same on any Windows, Macintosh, or Linux/Unix computer.</span> Getting R is straightforward, such as from the above link, which provides the link to download the app from the worldwide network of R servers.</p>
<p><em>Download R</em>.</p>
<p>From the download link, choose your operating system from the links at the top of the corresponding web page. For <em>Windows</em>, the top of the resulting web page has the download link. For <em>Mac</em>, several paragraphs down, in the left margin, you have a choice. The first link in the margin is for <code>arm64</code>, which is the version for the more recently developed Apple M series processors. A second link, further down the margin, applies to Appleâs older Intel CPU computers. If not sure of your CPU type, go the first choice under the Apple menu, About this Mac, and look at the information for Chip.</p>
<p><em>Install R</em>. If, during installation, you are asked the question, <em>Install in a personal library?</em> answer y for yes (unless you understand administrative privileges, which are needed if R is installed system-wide).</p>
<p>The installer offers both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Unless your computer was made around 2012 or earlier, run 64-bit software as you would any other app.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the installation proceeds as with any app. Accept the given defaults for each step of the process. When installed, run the R app as you would any other application, such as double-clicking on the applicationâs icon in your file system display. When opened, R displays a window called the <em>console</em>. Enter instructions into the R console command line, where R presents the <code>&gt;</code> prompt.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Usually, run R from within an app called RStudio</span> because of the additional features that RStudio provides. You can <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> now, or later, or never, but there are some advantages to running R from within RStudio.</p>
<p>From RStudio, you are running R at the standard R console, but within the RStudio environment. As shown in the following figure, RStudio divides the main window into several window panes, all resizable to customize for a specific analysis. The primary window pane is the standard R console, the same console available from running R by itself. A second window pane is where RStudio directs the data visualizations and can also display other information such as your file directory. A third window pane displays your data or your history of entered R instructions.</p>
<p>A potential fourth window pane in the top-left corner provides for files of R code, ready for analysis. Request this fourth window within RStudio by creating a new R script file as shown.</p>
<pre><code>File menu --&gt; New File --&gt; R Script</code></pre>

</p>
</div>
<p>R processes all instructions at the command prompt in the R console. One option is to enter the instructions at the command prompt. The short-coming of this approach is that the instructions need to be repeatedly entered every time the analysis is re-run.</p>
<p>RStudio improves this process by providing a convenient way to both store R instructions in their own file and then run them from the command prompt. An analysis of saved R instructions is reproducible. You can then save the file of R script for later access. You, or someone else in your organization, can repeat or extend the analysis without having to re-type everything.</p>
<p>Create a new R script file from the <code>New File</code> option on the RStudio <code>File</code> menu, which opens the top-left window pane in Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:RStudio">1.1</a>. Then, enter R instructions into the script window, select one or more instructions, and press the <code>Run</code> button at the top-right of the window pane. RStudio will then copy the selected information to the command prompt and run the instructions as if you had directly entered them into the console.</p>

<p>Or, click on the <code>Compile Report</code> button and send the input from the <code>Source</code> window and subsequent output to an HTML file for reading with a web browser or a Word document (a pdf option is also available, but requires LaTeX software installed).</p>
<p>Your choice: Enter and run individual instructions at the command line one-by-one or save your instructions over time to gradually build a collection to accomplish a variety of analyses. With this strategy, you can reproduce the output of any one analysis or do a simple modification to obtain a related analysis. Either way your data analyses get done.</p>

When using <strong>lessR</strong> you work in the same R environment and have access to the same R functions as any R user. The only distinction is that with my about 45 <strong>lessR</strong> functions available, R becomes simpler to use because each <strong>lessR</strong> function replaces several to many R functions plus additional programming code.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Data Table</em>: Organize data values into a rectangular data table with the data values for each variable in a column, and the name of the variable at the top of the column.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Store the structured data values within a computer file, on your computer, an accessible local network, or the world wide web. Encode the data table in one of a variety of computer file formats. The formats we encounter are Excel files, indicated by a file type of <code>.xlsx</code>, and text files in the form of comma-separated value files (csv).

<p>The data table in Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:dataTable">1.3</a>, formatted as an Excel file, contains four variables: <em>Years</em>, <em>Gender</em>, <em>Dept</em>, and <em>Salary</em> plus an ID field called <em>Name</em> for a total of five columns.

<p>Analysis of data can only proceed with the data table identified and the relevant variables in the data table identified by their names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All R functions analyze the data values within a data table for one or more specified variables, identified by their names, such as <i>Salary</i>.</p>

<p>Analysis requires the correct spelling of each variable name, including the same pattern of capitalization.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">To begin an analysis, read the data stored within a computer file into R.</span> Your data organized as a data table exists somewhere as a data file stored on a computer system, on your computer or a network, including the web. The data table may be stored in one of many different formats, including Excel. Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:file">1.4</a> shows a data table as an Excel file named <em>employee.xlsx</em> stored on a (Macintosh) computer. Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:dataTable">1.3</a> shows the first several lines of this data table in detail.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To analyze data within a data table stored in a computer file, first read the data table from the computer file into a corresponding data table within a running R session. R refers to a data table within R according to its name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Data frame</em>: A data table stored <i>within</i> an R session, referenced by its name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each variable in a data table has a name, and so does the data table itself. Reference the data table stored on your computer system by its file name and location. When read into R, name the data table, the R data frame, with a name of your choice. Regardless of the file name of your data on your computer system, typically name the data table <em>within</em> the active R session, the data frame, as simply <em>d</em> for data. Not only is <em>d</em> easy to type, it is also the <strong>lessR</strong> default data frame name for the data processed by its various analysis functions.</p>
<p>When analyzing data read into R, the same data exists in two different locations: a computer file on your computer system and an R data frame within a running R app. Different locations, different names: <em>same</em> data. On your computer system, identify the data table by its file name and location. A running R app identifies the same data from the data file by its data frame name, such as <em>d</em>.</p>
<p>Do a function call to read the data from a file into a data frame of a running R application. Multiple read functions are available from R as downloaded and from functions in different packages. We use the <strong>lessR</strong> function <code>Read()</code> for its simplicity and helpful output to better understand the data that R reads into a data frame. Analogous to multiple Excel worksheets in a single Excel file, a running R session can contain multiple data frames, though we usually work with only one, usually with the name of <em>d</em> for data.</p>
<div id="browse" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2.1</span> Browse for the Data Table File<a href="Rintro.html#browse" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><span class="newthought">To read the data, direct R to the location of the data file.</span> R cannot read the data file until it knows where the data is stored.
One option locates the data file on your computer system by browsing for it. You navigate your file system until you locate the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To locate your data file by browsing through your file system, call the <code>Read()</code> function with an empty file reference, <code>("")</code>, literally nothing between the quotes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are running R/RStudio in the cloud, your âlocalâ computer is your cloud account, not the computer from which you are accessing the cloud. That âcomputerâ could be any device, such as a tablet and an iPhone that does not even run R. So first upload your data file to your cloud account, as shown in the previously link reference <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/R/RStudioCloud.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud directions</a>.</p>
<p>The following <code>Read()</code> statement reads the data stored as a rectangular data table from an external file stored on your computer system such as an Excel file. The <code>Read()</code> statement reads the data from the file into an R data frame called <em>d</em>. The empty quotes indicate to R to open your file browser to locate the data file that already exists somewhere on your computer system.</p>

<p>As with all R (and Excel and Python and everything else) functions, the call to invoke the function includes a matching set of parentheses. Information within the parentheses specifies the information provided to the function for analysis.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;-</code> in the <code>Read()</code> statement indicates to assign what is on the right of the expression, here the data read from an external file, to the object on the left, here the R data frame stored within the R session, named <em>d</em> in this example. You can also use an ordinary equals sign, <code>=</code>, to indicate the assignment, but the <code>&lt;-</code> is more descriptive and more widely used by R practitioners.</p>

<span class="newthought">One way to locate a data file to be read explicitly specifies the location of the file</span> within the quotes and parentheses of the <code>Read()</code> function. Specify either the full path name of a file on your computer system, or specify a web address that locates the data table on the web. Again, read the data into the <em>d</em> data frame, remembering to include the quotes.
<p style="margin-top: .15em;">
<code>d &lt;- Read("path name" or "web address")</code>
</p>
<p>With Excel, R, or any other computer apps that process data, enclose character string values, such as a file name or web address (URL), in quotes. For example, to read the data from the web data file <em>employee.xlsx</em> into the data frame <em>d</em>, invoke the following <code>Read()</code> function call.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-4" class="example"><strong>Example 1.4  </strong></span>Â </p>

<p>To specify a location of the data file on your computer, provide the full path name that locates and names your data file. To obtain this path name, first browse for the file with <code>Read("")</code>. The resulting output displays the path name of the identified file. Copy this path name and insert between the quotes of <code>Read("")</code>, save this and other R function calls in a text file. Run the code in the future to directly read the data file for future analyses without needing to browse for its location.</p>
<p>In summary, with the <code>Read()</code> function, either put nothing between the quotes to browse for a data file, or specify the data fileâs location on your computer system or the web. Direct the data read from a file into an R data frame, usually named <em>d</em>, but can choose any valid name.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Always distinguish <em>continuous variables</em> from <em>categorical variables</em>.</span> This distinction between these two types of variables is fundamental in data analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continuous (quantitative) variable</em>: A numerical variable with many possible values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Categorical (qualitative) variable</em>: A variable with relatively few unique labels as data values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of continuous variables are <em>Salary</em> or <em>Time</em>, all defined on a numerical scale with many unique values. Examples of categorical variables are <em>Gender</em> or <em>State</em> of Residence. Each categorical variable has just a relatively few number of possible values compared to a continuous value. This distinction of continuous and categorical variables is common to virtually every data analysis project.</p>
<p>Sometimes that distinction gets a little confusing because variables with integer values, which are numeric, could be quantitative or qualitative. For example, sometimes Man, Woman, and Other are encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively, for three levels of the categorical variable <em>Gender</em>. However, these integer values are just labels for different non-numeric categories. Best to avoid this confusion. Instead, encode categorical variables with non-numeric values, such as <em>Gender</em>, for example, with M, W, and O for Other.</p>
<p>To distinguish between continuous and categorical variables, determine if the values of a variable are on a numerical scale, presumably with a relatively large number of unique values that can be ordered from smallest to largest value. A categorical variable such as <em>Gender</em>, however, coded numerically, does not imply the values are on a numerical scale. For example, Woman coded a 1, is not more than Man, coded as 0, or vice versa.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">The most fundamental analysis of data is counting</span> the occurrence of each data value, or group of similar data values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>General Principle</em>: Read the data table into an R data frame (table) with the <code>Read()</code> function, then analyze specific variables in that data table, each referenced by its name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All data analysis in R follows from the names of the relevant variables as stored within the relevant data table. In the function call for a data analysis, include the variable name, such as <em>Salary</em>, a continuous variable, or <em>Gender</em>, a categorical variable.
The <strong>lessR</strong> <code>Read()</code> function lists the variable names as part of its output. Each analysis is of one or more variables, <em>not</em> the entire data table. Distinguish between the name of the data table, and the name of the variable(s) that exist within the data table.</p>
<p>Effectively communicate the results with data visualizations. The type of visualization for counting data values, as with most analyses, depends on the type of variable, categorical or continuous.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Bar Chart and Pie Chart<a href="Rintro.html#bar-chart-and-pie-chart" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="newthought">One of the most encountered data visualizations is the bar chart.</span> Create a bar chart or pie chart from the categories (levels) of a categorical variable with a number associated with each category. First, the bar chart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bar Chart</em>: Plot a bar for each level of a categorical variable with its height scaled according to the value of the associated numerical variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bar chart requires <em>two</em> variables to plot, the categorical variable and the associated numerical variable. The number associated with each level (category) could be any number. A bar chart is constructed from the information in a table with two columns. One column contains the name of each category of the categorical variable. In the second column of this simple table is the number associated with each category, which translates into the height of the corresponding bar.</p>
<p>What is the source of the table from which the bar chart is constructed? One possibility provides the table directly to the bar chart function. Another possibility, examined here first, has the computer construct that table from the original data as a summary table or, using Excel language, a pivot table. The most common application of the computer constructing the table is the count of how many times each category appeared in the data. For example, from the class grade book, how many students in the class received an A for their course grade? An A-? â¦ and so on. When visualizing the distribution of counts, the height of each bar is proportional to the count, or frequency, of how many times the corresponding level in the data occurred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Frequency distribution</em>: A pivot table constructed by counting the number of times each value occurred in the data for a variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>lessR</strong> bar chart function, <code>BarChart()</code>, provides both the bar chart and the summary table from which the bar chart is constructed.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">One possibility creates the bar chart from the data table of measurements.</span> Data analysis ultimately begins with the measured data values. To plot a bar chart, first <a href="Rintro.html#read">read</a> the data table of measurements from a computer file into the R data frame named <em>d</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Raw data</em>: The original, measured data values before any summarization or transformation.</p>

<p>An example of <a href="Rintro.html#dt">raw data</a> is the data table of employees with variables such as <em>Salary</em> and <em>Gender</em> in Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:dataTable">1.3</a>. The data values for each employee are the original data values from which the analysis begins, recorded as measurements. To begin the analysis, <a href="#exm:ReadURL">read</a> these data values into an R data frame, usually named <em>d</em>.</p>
<p>Consider a data frame of the raw data that contains a categorical variable, here referred to with the generic name <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. For a specific analysis, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> takes on a specific name, such as <em>Gender</em> or <em>Dept</em>. One way to construct the corresponding bar chart is to use the <strong>lessR</strong> interactive analysis, called by entering <code>interact("BarChart")</code> into the R console.

<p>A call to a function to create a bar chart necessarily contains the name of the variable with values that are the categories to plot. For example, for categorical variable <em>Gender</em>, values of Woman, Man, and Other.</p>
<p>With the <code>BarChart()</code> function, the name of the categorical variable is the first value passed to the function, and often, as in this example, the <em>only</em> value passed to the function. If the data frame is named <em>d</em>, then do not need the <code>data</code> parameter. If a bar chart is constructed from two variables, and only the categorical variable is supplied to the function, what is the unspecified numerical variable?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When only the name of one categorical variable name is passed to <code>BarChart()</code>, the visualization is of the variableâs distribution, the height of the bar for each category as the corresponding count of the number of occurrences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To illustrate, return to the <a href="Rintro.html#dt">data</a> in Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:dataTable">1.3</a>. First, <a href="Rintro.html#location">read</a> the data into R as the <em>d</em> data frame. Given the data, <code>BarChart()</code> tabulates and displays the number of employees in each department, according to the variable named Dept. The values of <em>Dept</em> are in the default data frame (table) named <em>d</em>.</p>
<p>The result is the bar chart in Figure <a href="#fig:bcEx"><strong>??</strong></a> for the distribution of the values of the categorical variable <em>Dept</em>. Note that the only information passed to <code>BarChart()</code> in this example is the name of the categorical variable to analyze. By default, <code>BarChart()</code> identifies the count of occurrence of each category in the data as the corresponding numerical variable to plot.</p>

<p>Obtain the same analysis by including the <code>data</code> parameter to explicitly identify the name of the data frame.</p>
<pre><code>BarChart(Dept, data=d)</code></pre>
<p>Again, if the data frame that contains the variable of interest is named <em>d</em>, then no need to include the <code>data</code> parameter. If the data frame name is something other than <em>d</em>, then include the parameter to identify the data table that contains the variable of interest. When doing R analyses you can have as many data tables as your computer memory will allow.</p>
<p>The <code>BarChart()</code> function provides a default color theme, which also labels each bar with the associated percentage of values for the corresponding category. The <code>BarChart()</code> function provides the tabular form of the frequency distribution, an example of a pivot table, as part of its text output to the R console, as shown in the above output. The counts appear in the row labeled Frequencies, with the categories in the previous row.</p>
<p>From the frequency distribution that pairs a number with each category or level of the variable of interest, <code>BarChart()</code> visualizes that pairing with the bar chart. In this example, the frequency distribution reveals that there are five accountants (ACCT), six administrators (ADMN), four financial analysts (FINC), six marketers (MKTG), and 15 people working in sales (SALE). From this information, a bar chart function defines the bars and their associated heights.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">A bar chart visualizes the number associated with each category.</span> In the previous example, the data entered into the analysis consisted of the <a href="Rintro.html#dt">raw data</a>, the original measurements. The <code>BarChart()</code> function then automatically proceeded to tabulate how many times each level of the categorical variable occurred in the data.</p>
<p>In general, construct a bar chart from <em>any</em> table that lists the pairing of each category with some number that translates into the height of the bar for that category. The summary table need not be a frequency distribution, a count of how many times each value occurred. Indeed, the table of categories and corresponding numbers could be completely nonsensical. To apply in the real world, of course, the table usually provides meaningful information, even if not counts. One example is the height of the starting center for each NBA team. The table would be a list of all NBA teams, each team paired with a number such as 83, for 83 inches tall.</p>
<p>Continuing the previous example of employment in various company departments, suppose the summary table of the counts is already available, but not the raw data, the original data table of measurements. Maybe you found a company report that listed the count of employees in each department, and from that table, wish to create the corresponding bar chart.</p>
<p>In this instance, read the summary table into R as the data to analyze, the values that <code>BarChart()</code> implicitly computed in the previous example. Or, easily compute the summary table, the category and counts, in Excel directly, as a pivot table, or even more simply with the <strong>lessR</strong> function <code>pivot()</code>. Or, if available from another source, enter the summary table directly into Excel. In this example, simply locate the already constructed summary table on the web.</p>

<p>To create the bar chart from the summary table, specify the categorical variable as before, and then specify the numerical variable that maps to each barâs height.

Here explicitly set the bin width to 13,000 USD for the histogram of Salary instead of relying upon the default bin width provided by R. The resulting histogram in Figure <a href="#fig:h13000"><strong>??</strong></a> is smoother than the original in Figure <a href="#fig:h"><strong>??</strong></a>. Also, in this example, turn off the console output with the <code>quiet</code> parameter.</p>

<p>There are many different parameters for most functions, discussed in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="params" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Parameter Values<a href="Rintro.html#params" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="newthought">A variety of conditions control the output of each analysis, text or visualization.</span>
A bar chart or a histogram, for example, requires colors for the bars, colors for the bar edges, labels for the axes, and many other characteristics. In terms of text output, for example, the maximum width of each line must be pre-set before analysis begins.</p>
<p>Characteristics such as bar color and maximum line width are not hard-coded into the function but instead can be customized. This logic applies to any analysis system, such as Excel or R.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Parameter</em>: A user-controlled value of a functionâs code, a placeholder, that specifies some characteristic of the way the data is processed or the output of the function is displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each function includes parameters to customize input or output. For any bar chart or histogram function from any analysis system, such as Excel or R, one parameter sets the color of the bars, and another parameter sets the color of the bar edges.</p>
<p>To use a function and have to manually select all the parameter values manually would be much too tedious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Default parameter value</em>: A preset value of a parameter, unless explicitly changed when invoking the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each function consists of several or even many different parameter values set at default values. For example, the <code>BarChart()</code> and <code>Histogram()</code> parameter <code>fill</code> sets the color that fills the bars. By default, <code>BarChart()</code> displays each bar in a different color, but the bars can also be set at the same color. To change the color of all the bars to a blue shade, here set the <code>fill</code> parameter to <code>"steelblue"</code>, one of many R defined colors.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Explore these parameter values and their effect on the resulting visualization interactively with the <strong>lessR</strong> function <code>interact()</code>. To use, provide the name of the visualization contained in quotes, such as <code>interact(BarChart)</code> or <code>interact("Histogram")</code>.</p>

<p>Parameter values can be numeric or a character string such as a word or a letter. As is true of all computer analysis systems such as Excel and R, if a parameter value is a character string, enclose its value in quotes. For example, <code>"steelblue"</code>. Specify numbers without quotes, such as <code>1300</code> in the previous example of setting the bin width of a histogram.</p>
<p>Also, as is true of Excel and other analysis systems such as R, the general format for setting a parameter value <em>within</em> the call to a function follows in Figure <a href="Rintro.html#fig:parameters">1.16</a>. The three dots, â¦, in the figure indicate other stuff that is part of the function call, such as a variable name.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In the <code>BarChart()</code> example above, <code>fill</code> names the parameter. The value of <code>"steelblue"</code> is the specific value set for that parameter. Explicitly setting that parameter value overrides the default value of <code>BarChart()</code>, which provides a different color for each bar.</p>
<p>Parameters control many aspects of the way that a function processes data, far more aspects than just color. You can rely upon the default parameter values, or add more paired parameter names and values as there are parameters to add. Customize the resulting bar chart, or rely upon the default values that <strong>lessR</strong> provides without customizing anything. Every R function has a help file that reveals the parameters associated with that function. To see all the possibilities of applying the function, display the help file for the function. To view its contents, enter a question mark, ?, followed by the function name.</p>
<p>As another example, there is a <em>data</em> parameter for <strong>lessR</strong> analysis functions such as <code>BarChart()</code> that specifies the name of the data table that contains the variable(s) to analyze. These functions default to the data table name <em>d</em>, so no need to specify the parameter if referring to the default name.</p>
<pre><code>?BarChart</code></pre>
<p>Toward the beginning of the help file, find a list of all the parameters, their default values, and an explanation of each.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Follow one of two strategies for reporting your work in R.</span> The choice of format to use is yours. One method is to do a manual copy and paste from R output, text and graphics, into a word processing document such as Word. Or, let R do the work for you, using one of two methods: Compile Report or R Markdown. The R Markdown method is ultimately more useful, but for this class the Compile Report method works just fine.</p>
<div id="figures" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.6.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1.1</span> Copy and Paste<a href="Rintro.html#figures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><span class="newthought"></span> For the first technique, manually construct a word processing document, such as for a homework assignment. Copy and paste text and graphics output from R into the MS Word or other word processing app document.</p>
<p><em>Text</em>: All input and output to the R Console, with or without RStudio, is pure text. So select and copy the desired output and paste into MS Word or, for example, an email (no screenshot). Display the text in a mono-spaced font, such as Courier New. First, this lines up the columns of tables, and second, this distinguishes computer output in your writing from words that you write yourself, such as interpretative text.</p>
<p><em>Graphics</em>: For RStudio use the <em>Export</em> button at the top of the window pane for Plots. Then select <em>Copy to Clipboard</em> and paste into the app such Word. Generally, re-size the image to better fit on the page.</p>

Or, start with the <code>+</code> sign at the top-left corner of the RStudio window to create the new text file. Then enter the R instructions into the text file window pane.</p>
<p>From the window pane, can run the code with the <code>Run</code> button at the top-right of the window-pane for the file. Or, even better, click on the <code>Compile Report</code> button. Then choose MS Word as the output medium.</p>

<p>Develop your reports that use R for analytics directly in RStudio using R Markdown as a single, integrated report. The output can be HTML for a web page, or .docx for MS Word. R can directly generate web pages and Word documents (plus pdfâs) as standard output using R Markdown.
To apply to homework assignments, copy and paste the homework questions into an RStudio text file, perhaps just the worked problems part of the homework. Then adjust R code as needed, plus your interpretations.</p>
<p>Again, a relatively small investment of time to obtain more useful skills for doing data analysis.</p>

The <strong>lessR</strong> <code>style()</code> function provides many color themes. The default is <code>colors</code>. Other styles include <code>darkred</code> and <code>lightbronze</code>. To change the style for all subsequent visualizations, enter the chosen theme name in quotes.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0em;">
<code>style("darkred")</code>
</p>
<p>A call to the style function with a new theme changes many colors at once.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0em;">
Individual properties of a visualization can also be customized separately from the entire theme. Two essential parameters for individual customization:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fill</code> for the interior color of a region such as a bar or a point</li>
<li><code>color</code> for the color of a line segment, either by itself or as the edge of a region such as a bar or point.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0em;">
To see all available theme and individual properties amenable to customization, enter: <code>style(show=TRUE)</code>
